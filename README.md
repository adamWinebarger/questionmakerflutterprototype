# questionmakermobile

This is meant to be the mobile app side of the questionmaker project.

The aim for the mobile app is to be able to grab relevant data from patients corresponding to a given code - including pre-written questions - store the answers input by the end-user, and then send those answers back to the database for further review.

## Still Todo:

- Add firebase functionality
- Finish the Answer screen.
- Other stuff?
