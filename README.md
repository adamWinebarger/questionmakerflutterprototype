# questionmakermobile

This is meant to be the mobile app side of the questionmaker project.

The aim for the mobile app is to be able to grab relevant data from patients corresponding to a given code - including pre-written questions - store the answers input by the end-user, and then send those answers back to the database for further review.

## Still Todo:

- Set up catches for when the app can't connect to the firestore database
- Set up some sort of auth
- ???
